LPL College Readiness Check


LPL Financial’s 4th Annual University Hackathon — Using AI to Build AI


A lightweight, AI-assisted prototype that helps families quickly understand whether they are on track to fund college education and how investment risk impacts that outcome.


Overview:

Users enter basic information (student age, savings, contribution rate, college type, and investment style) to receive a readiness status, projected tuition and savings, a funding gap or surplus, and an advisor-style explanation with a recommended next step.

The tool is designed to support LPL financial advisors, serving as a conversation starter rather than a replacement.


Features:

- Risk-aware investment style assumptions

- Clear readiness status with explainability

- Advisor-first user experience

- Enterprise-style UI aligned with LPL values


Tech:

- HTML + Tailwind CSS frontend

- Cloud-ready AWS architecture

- AI explanation layer designed for Amazon Bedrock (mocked in demo)
